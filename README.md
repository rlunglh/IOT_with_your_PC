# IOT_with_your_PC
Support files for the IOT with your PC book

All examples are for an ESP32 or ESP8266 Processor as
a WiFi peripheral to the PC

Wiring examples assume use of a Wemos D1 mini footprint

Code soon to be updated to run either with ESP8266 or ESP32
If you use a D1 mini footprint compatible ESP32, the building
block hardware is also applicable to ESP32 projects
